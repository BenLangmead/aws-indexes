Catalog of genomic indexes freely available from public clouds.  Meant to be viewed as a [GitHub Pages website](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/).

# Other resources

Many thanks to Illunina for maintaining the excellent [iGenomes](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html) resource.

For access to [iGenomes](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html)-style indexes, sequences and annotations, check out [AWS iGenomes](https://ewels.github.io/AWS-iGenomes/).  These are best accessed from AWS (e.g. from EC2 instances) in region `eu-west-1`.
