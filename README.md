# aws-indexes

Catalog of genomic indexes freely available from public clouds thanks to the [AWS Public Dataset Program].  Meant to be viewed as a [GitHub Pages website](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/).

We expect this resource will be useful to regular users of Bowtie ([1](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net) & [2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2)), [HISAT2](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/), [Kraken 2/Bracken](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki) and [Centrifuge](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/).  The links will allow downloads from `https://` URLs, so users can download from anywhere.

Users working in the cloud, e.g. on AWS EC2 instances, gain a particular advantage because they can potentially download the data directly (e.g. using the AWS CLI).  That will be fast and free.  Since we are part of the [AWS Public Dataset Program], the data can be accessed from _any AWS region_ free of charge.  (Normally, inter-region transfers carry a fee.)
